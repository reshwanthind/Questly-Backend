# Questly ðŸ§ 
*A community-powered Q&A platform â€“ ask, answer, learn.*

## Project Overview

Questly is a scalable backend system for a modern Question & Answer platform. The application allows users to register, ask questions, answer them, follow subjects using tags, and participate in a collaborative knowledge community.

## Features

- User registration and authentication
- Posting, updating, and searching questions and answers
- Tag-based the content organization and discovery
- Followers and notification system for updates on relevant topics (using tags)
- RESTful API endpoints for frontend consumption
- Scalable architecture ready for cloud deployment

## Tech Stack

- **Java 21**
- **Spring Boot (Spring MVC & Spring Data JPA)**
- **Jakarta EE Annotations**
- **Lombok** for boilerplate code 
- **Elasticsearch** for advanced search capabilities and scalability
- **Docker** for containerized deployment of Elasticsearch

## Getting Started
